    <h4> <b><u> Stock Market:</b></u></h4>
    Stock market is a place where people buy/sell shares of publicly listed companies.<br>
     It offers a platform to facilitate seamless exchange of shares.
      <br>In simple terms, if A wants to sell shares of Reliance Industries,<br> the stock market will help him to meet the seller who is willing to buy Reliance Industries. <br>However, it is important to note that a person can trade in the stock market only through a registered intermediary known as a stock broker. The buying and selling of shares take place through electronic medium. We will discuss more about the stock brokers at a later point.
     <br>
     <b><h4><u>Stock Exchanges in India:</b></h4></u>
      There are two main stock exchanges in India where majority of the trades take place <br>- Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and
       the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Apart from these two exchanges,
       <br> there are some other regional stock exchanges like Bangalore Stock Exchange,
       Madras Stock Exchange etc but these exchanges do not play a meaningful role anymore.</p>
